He writes his own text book (which he gives you) so he knows the content inside and out. Lots of detailed examples and demos. Homeworks are the perfect length, interesting, and on topic. Easy recommendation.",

          "review": "He is a nice professor but not a good exam maker. His exam focus too much on tiny details and takes away a lot of points. I took both 382 and 392, and the exam was hard asf. Based on what he said this is the third year he teach. I was told 382 exam average 2022 was 36 , 2023 was 46 or 56, so do work hard for exam",

The exams are extremely difficult, you can expect to spend a lot of time doing practice questions on your own if you wish to do well on the exams. For your reference, the course average for most exams are in the 60-70s.",

I managed to get 100s on most of the homework/labs, but I allocated more hours than I should have for this class. The grading certainly doesn't help, since 36% was the average for the first exam.",

The first midterm had 75% of the class get below a 60, but the class turned around after the first half. He is a great lecturer and changed a lot over the semester. The class was loads of fun after he changed. High workload!",

They all felt fair except for std392io and midterm 2. I enjoyed him and the lectures. If you don't get a 100 on an assignment, no extra credit for it. Very knowledgeable, but still learning how to be a good professor.",

The homework and the labs do not really relate to what we are learning in class, and honestly some of the assembly ones just feel like busy work. Do not recommend.",

He goes out of his way to connect with students and provide help when we ask for it. He also listens to course feedback and curves the class. You may have to email him a few times about misgraded work.",

For labs little to nothing to do with the actual things you learn in the class. makes you write assembly code of things that would be ten times easier to code in c++, java, or python like merge sort.

I was learning a lot in the beginning, but then I stopped paying attention after a certain point and I was just so lost. Very heavy on homework and labs. Only bad thing is that grading is not consistent. There is a lot of bad grading but if you email him, he will fix it.",
